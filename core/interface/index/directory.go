// CompositeReader
// Instances of this reader type can only be used to get stored fields from the underlying LeafReaders,
// but it is not possible to directly retrieve postings. To do that, get the LeafReaderContext for all
// sub-readers via leaves().
//
// IndexReader instances for indexes on disk are usually constructed with a call to one of the static
// DirectoryReader.open() methods, e.g. DirectoryReader.open(Directory). DirectoryReader implements
// the CompositeReader interface, it is not possible to directly get postings.
// Concrete subclasses of IndexReader are usually constructed with a call to one of the static open()
// methods, e.g. DirectoryReader.open(Directory).
//
// For efficiency, in this API documents are often referred to via document numbers, non-negative integers
// which each name a unique document in the index. These document numbers are ephemeral -- they may change
// as documents are added to and deleted from an index. Clients should thus not rely on a given document
// having the same number between sessions.
//
// NOTE: IndexReader instances are completely thread safe, meaning multiple threads can call any of its
// methods, concurrently. If your application requires external synchronization, you should not
// synchronize on the IndexReader instance; use your own (non-Lucene) objects instead.

	// Check whether any new changes have occurred to the index since this reader was opened.

	// (see IndexWriter.commit) have occurred in the directory.
	// If instead this reader is a near real-time reader (ie, obtained by a call to open(IndexWriter),
	// or by calling openIfChanged on a near real-time reader), then this method checks if either a
	// new commit has occurred, or any new uncommitted changes have taken place via the writer.
	// Note that even if the writer has only performed merging, this method will still return false.
	// In any event, if this returns false, you should call openIfChanged to get a new reader that sees the changes.
