package search

// IndexSearcher Implements search over a single IndexReader.
// Applications usually need only call the inherited search(Query, int) method. For performance reasons, if your
// index is unchanging, you should share a single IndexSearcher instance across multiple searches instead of
// creating a new one per-search. If your index has changed and you wish to see the changes reflected in searching,
// you should use DirectoryReader.openIfChanged(DirectoryReader) to obtain a new reader and then create a new
// IndexSearcher from that. Also, for low-latency turnaround it's best to use a near-real-time reader
// (DirectoryReader.open(IndexWriter)). Once you have a new IndexReader, it's relatively cheap to create a
// new IndexSearcher from it.
// NOTE: The search and searchAfter methods are configured to only count top hits accurately up to 1,000 and may
// return a lower bound of the hit count if the hit count is greater than or equal to 1,000. On queries that match
// lots of documents, counting the number of hits may take much longer than computing the top hits so this
// trade-off allows to get some minimal information about the hit count without slowing down search too much.
// The TopDocs.scoreDocs array is always accurate however. If this behavior doesn't suit your needs, you should
// create collectors manually with either TopScoreDocCollector.create or TopFieldCollector.create and call
// search(Query, Collector).
// NOTE: IndexSearcher instances are completely thread safe, meaning multiple threads can call any of its
// methods, concurrently. If your application requires external synchronization, you should not synchronize on
// the IndexSearcher instance; use your own (non-Lucene) objects instead.
