// MergePolicy Expert: a MergePolicy determines the sequence of primitive merge operations.
// Whenever the segments in an index have been altered by IndexWriter, either the addition of a newly
// flushed segment, addition of many segments from addIndexes* calls, or a previous merge that may now
// need to cascade, IndexWriter invokes findMerges to give the MergePolicy a chance to pick merges that
// are now required. This method returns a MergePolicy.MergeSpecification instance describing the set
// of merges that should be done, or null if no merges are necessary. When IndexWriter.forceMerge is
// called, it calls findForcedMerges(SegmentInfos, int, Map, MergePolicy.MergeContext) and the MergePolicy
// should then return the necessary merges.
//
// Note that the policy can return more than one merge at a time. In this case, if the writer is using
// SerialMergeScheduler, the merges will be run sequentially but if it is using ConcurrentMergeScheduler
// they will be run concurrently.
//
// The default MergePolicy is TieredMergePolicy.

// MergeContext This interface represents the current context of the merge selection process. It allows
// to access real-time information like the currently merging segments or how many deletes a segment
// would claim back if merged. This context might be stateful and change during the execution of a
// merge policy's selection processes.

// resulting in a single new segment. The merge spec includes the subset of segments to be merged
// as well as whether the new segment should use the compound file format.
