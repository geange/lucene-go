// MergePolicy Expert: a MergePolicy determines the sequence of primitive merge operations.
// Whenever the segments in an index have been altered by IndexWriter, either the addition of a newly
// flushed segment, addition of many segments from addIndexes* calls, or a previous merge that may now
// need to cascade, IndexWriter invokes findMerges to give the MergePolicy a chance to pick merges that
// are now required. This method returns a MergePolicy.MergeSpecification instance describing the set
// of merges that should be done, or null if no merges are necessary. When IndexWriter.forceMerge is
// called, it calls findForcedMerges(SegmentInfos, int, Map, MergePolicy.MergeContext) and the MergePolicy
// should then return the necessary merges.
//
// Note that the policy can return more than one merge at a time. In this case, if the writer is using
// SerialMergeScheduler, the merges will be run sequentially but if it is using ConcurrentMergeScheduler
// they will be run concurrently.
//
// The default MergePolicy is TieredMergePolicy.
