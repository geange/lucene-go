// ByteBlockPool Class that Posting and PostingVector use to write byte streams into shared fixed-size
// byte[] arrays. The idea is to allocate slices of increasing lengths For example, the first slice is 5 bytes,
// the next slice is 14, etc. We start by writing our bytes into the first 5 bytes. When we hit the end of
// the slice, we allocate the next slice and then write the address of the new slice into the last 4 bytes of
// the previous slice (the "forwarding address"). Each slice is filled with 0's initially, and we mark the end
// with a non-zero byte. This way the methods that are writing into the slice don't need to record its length
// and instead allocate a new slice once they hit a non-zero byte.
