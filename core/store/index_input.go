// IndexInput Abstract base class for input from a file in a Directory. A random-access input stream. Used for
// all Lucene index input operations.
//
// IndexInput may only be used from one thread, because it is not thread safe (it keeps internal state like
// file position). To allow multithreaded use, every IndexInput instance must be cloned before it is used in
// another thread. Subclasses must therefore implement clone(), returning a new IndexInput which operates on
// the same underlying resource, but positioned independently.
//
// Warning: Lucene never closes cloned IndexInputs, it will only call close() on the original object.
// If you access the cloned IndexInput after closing the original object, any readXXX methods will throw
// AlreadyClosedException.
// See Also: Directory
